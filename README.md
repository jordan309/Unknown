# Overview
This is an android text-based survival game. The genre of the game is horror.

The idea for this game came from wanting to know how someone's thinking process would determine their ability to survive. The intensity feeling one gets when dealing with a serious situation / scenario will help create a connection between the character and player. Being in a position of uncertainty and danger is the fear factor about this game. The game's in-depth dark storyline sets the horror theme. The time limit restriction will make the game more challenging as the player will have to make a choice before the time ends if they do not want to lose percentage on all values. The purpose of this game was to make the player doubt whether they are making the right decision, to see if they trust their own instincts. Understanding the fundamentals to survive is important but can sometimes cause a  positive or negative result. Not having the ability to be able to kill or understand the spirits is a reason why the game is called Unknown.  

The end of civilisation is near, spirits roam the earth now. In 2050, an experiment to bring back the dead, had gone drastically wrong and has caused many lost souls to return. A single touch from a spirit will kill any human instantly, they can spot humans from miles away, have the ability to float and fly if necessary. This has resulted in survivors having to find safe places to sleep, collect food, water and keep sane to survive. Going outside is now extremely dangerous, especially at night time. Other survivors may come in your path but beware, not all can be trusted. The further the character progresses, the more difficult the decisions become. Each situation will have an effect on the percentage values, which will determine the fate of the character.
