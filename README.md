# Overview
This is an android text-based survival game. The genre of the game is horror.

The idea for this game came from wanting to know how someone's thinking process would determine their ability to survive. The intensity feeling one gets when dealing with a serious situation / scenario will help create a connection between the character and player. Being in a position of uncertainty and not knowing what will happen is the fear factor about this game. The stories in-depth dark storyline sets the horror theme, it's limited time will only increase the challenge of completing this game. Understanding the fundamentals to survive and trusting your gut feeling of what is the right decision will determine positive or negative results. During the storyline, there won't be a safe time to relax.


The end of civilization is near, spirits roam the earth now. They can see you but you can't see them. You have to hide when necessary, collect food, water and keep sane to survive. You may come across other survivors, be careful who you choose to trust. You will start with 100% on hunger, hydration and sanity levels. The choices you make will result in either decreasing or increasing these levels. Survival will be determined by the choices you make. Think you can survive for 100 hours? The further you progress into a story of a character, the more difficult it will be to survive.
