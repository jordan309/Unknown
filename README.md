This is an android text-based survival game. The setting of the game is in an apocalyptic world. The player’s objective is to collect 
food, water and find shelter to survive. The story will progress via text and allow the player to have opportunities that will 
determine their survival. 

The user will start with 100% on their hunger, dehydration and hyperthermia levels but the player’s choices will result in either 
decreasing or increasing these levels.  

The objective of the game is to survive for 100 game hours (not real time), this will be determined by the player’s choices. 
The player will need to survive for 100 hours some decisions will appear with a 20 second timer to make the user panic and make a 
fast choice. The further the user progresses, the more difficult the game will be to survive. There will be four stories, following 
4 individual characters with unique endings.
