This is an android text-based survival game. The genre of the game is horror.

The end of civilization is near, spirits roam the earth now. They can see you but you can't see them. You have to hide when necessary, collect food, water and keep sane to survive. You may come across other survivors, be careful who you choose to trust. You will start with 100% on hunger, hydration and sanity levels. The choices you make will result in either decreasing or increasing these levels. Survival will be determined by the choices you make. Think you can survive for 100 hours? The further you progress into a story of a character, the more difficult it will be to survive.

May God be with you.
