This is an android text-based survival game. The genre of the game is horror, there are not many humans left on earth. Spirits are everywhere, one touch and they will drain the life from you.. survivors do what they can to gather resources but outside is a dangerous place. The choices the player will make are difficult, a timer will also be a challenge to decide on a decision. 

There are 4 characters to choose from. The player will begin with 100% food, hydration and sanity levels. Each choice will either increase or decrease these levels. If the player gets to 0% on any of the 3, they have lost the game and were unable to survive. Each character will have their own special ability that can be used during any part of the game, this will help them choose a correct choice and skip a certain part. The further the player progresses, the more difficult the game will be to survive.
