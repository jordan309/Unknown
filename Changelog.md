The following work is the result of many hard hours of learning and tutorials to understand multidimensonal arrays and how they can be used to solve the data issue with our game without the use of a database.

- Remade the questions class
- Added a 5 dimensional array to the questions class that allows data for the game to be stored and accessed

In order to make the game work I created the following new variables and added made sure they interacted with the array containing the game data.

- mA2AnswerEffectValues
- mA3AnswerEffectValues
- mA1AnswerEffectOperator
- mA2AnswerEffectOperator
- mA3AnswerEffectOperator
- mA1Type
- mA2Type

Answer Effect Values indicated the interger value of how the answer on any specific question will effect the players resources.
Answer Effect Operator determines if the above integer is positive or negative
Type dictates which resource the above to values are effecting between hunger, water, sanity
